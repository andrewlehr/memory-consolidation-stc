# Memory consolidation in recurrent spiking neural networks


## Outline

This package serves to simulate recurrent spiking neural networks with calcium-based synaptic plasticity and synaptic tagging and capture.
The generic C++ code and build scripts for specific simulations are located in the directory __simulation-code/__. Building will create binaries in the directory __simulation-bin/__, which contains scripts to run the specific simulations. Building has been tested with g++ 10.3.0 and boost 1.77.0 on Linux kernel 5.13.0. Besides that, pre-compiled binaries are available as part of the latest release.

The directory __analysis/__ contains Python scripts serving to analyze the data produced by the simulations.

The simulation is run by executing the binary file with or without command line options (as defined in __NetworkMain.cpp__, e.g., via one of the following shell scripts).
Please note that in addition there are preprocessor options that can be set before compiling (e.g., in __NetworkSimulation.cpp__) but cannot be changed during
runtime.

The binaries and run scripts for the studies mentioned above are located in subdirectories of __simulation-bin/__. Please note that some of these scripts trigger a cascade of many simulations by using the `screen` command. This may cause less powerful machines to take very long or to run into memory issues. In those cases, you might consider to run simulations separately.

	* __run_IRS__ - learn a memory representation, save the network state, and recall after 10 seconds; load the network state, apply intermediate stimulation, let the memory representation consolidate, and recall after 8 hours
	* __run_sizes__ - learn a memory representation, save the network state, and recall after 10 seconds; load the network state, let the memory representation consolidate, and recall after 8 hours
	* __connections.txt__ - the default connectivity matrix used in this study; if this file is absent, the simulation program will automatically generate a new network structure

## Analysis scripts

The following scripts serve to process and analyze the data produced by the simulation code. They were tested to run with Python 3.7.3, NumPy 1.20.1, SciPy 1.6.0, and pandas 1.0.3.
Please note that some of the script files are interdependent.
Also note that not all script files and functions have to be used to reproduce the results of any single study mentioned above.
