The notebook __code/figure_reproduction.ipynb__ reproduces most figures from **Lehr, Luboeinski & Tetzlaff, 2022**. It uses the __stcAnalysisClass__ found in the main analysis folder of this project. There you will find the relevant methods used for data analysis, statistics, and figure generation.

**IMPORTANT.** First get the raw data from LINK and put it in *lehr_luboeinski_tetzlaff_2022/raw_data/* to be able to run the notebook. If you also download the processed data and put it in *lehr_luboeinski_tetzlaff_2022/processed_data/* then most analysis will be skipped automatically and it will take the already analysed/processed data. This is of course faster if you do not want to reproduce everything.
